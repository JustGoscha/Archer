# The World of Archer(tm)

It is a post-apocalyptic world. The nature has reclaimed most of the land once inhibited by humans. The human race has failed to manage the climate catastrophies that it summoned upon themselves and so once the tipping point of Carbon Dioxyde saturation in the atmosphere was reached, it started a vicious chain reaction that should change the majority of the climate, landscapes, flora and fauna of the earth. 

Few of the large animals survived this incident in their previous form. Only the most adaptable, like insects, bacteria and some small mammals. These new animals where developing faster and into more obscure forms, since the radiation in the atmosphere was much higher than in the previous millions of years. This has led to many mutations. 

The human race, also survived, but they were doomed to live in vaults and caves, avoiding the direct sunlight and polluted air. They were organized in local groups that were trying to survive as long as possible with all the equipment they had to their disposal. States and governmenst had fallen apart long ago. There was no universal law anymore. It was back to survival of the fittest. 

Lucky were those who had there hands on big canned food supplys and bottles of fresh water and, of course, oxygen. Even better, was having water and air filtering systems. But those were rare, at least the ones that worked flawlessly. Hence, many suffered diseases, cancer and other mutations, hunger and fear. 

The demand for food and air was the driving force to get the humans out of the caves into the wild and dangerous lands. Small tribes could travel together, but many larger ones could only afford to send a few. Many a man moved out to get supplies for their group but never returned, often realizing that it was hopeless to find enough to save all of them, or just joined another group if they could convince them of their usefulness, or simpy died being eaten by hungry predators or being shot by other men.

It was no easy task to go out. You needed a whole lot of equipment. A mobile air filtering system for your mouth or nose, a spair bottle of oxygen for really tough regions, water, a Geiger-Müller-Zähler to avoid places of intense radiation. An outfit that could sufficiently protect you from the sun and other exterior perils, and a weapon, to protect yourself from animals and humans.
